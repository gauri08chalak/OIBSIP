        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Ratan Tata, in full Ratan Naval Tata, (born December 28, 1937, Bombay [now Mumbai], India), Indian businessman who became chairman (1991–2012 and 2016–17) of the Tata Group, a Mumbai-based conglomerate.
            
            Sir Ratan joined the firm of Tata & Sons as a partner in 1896. After the death of his father in 1904, he looked after the affairs of the L’ Union Fire Insurance Co of Paris, 
            of which Tata & Sons were the agents in India.
            He was also in charge of the trading firm Tata & Co, which had branches in Kobe, Shanghai, Paris, New York and Rangoon, 
            and traded in cotton, yarn, silk, pearls and rice.

            In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group.
             He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse 
             during an economic slowdown. In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. 
            Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational freedom 
            under the senior Tata's tenure.
